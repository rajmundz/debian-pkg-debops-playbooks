  synopsis: |
    This role installs [PHPMyAdmin](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/) interface for
    MySQL database. At the moment it is designed to manage only a database on
    `localhost`, and is usually enabled by `debops.mysql` role itself in
    a specifically written play. In the future it will be redesigned as
    a standalone installation when secure access to remote databases is
    available.
