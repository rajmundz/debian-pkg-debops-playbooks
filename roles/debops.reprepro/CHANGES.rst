v0.1.2
------

  [drybjed]

v0.1.1
------

*Released: 2015-04-30*

- Backport repositories have been redesigned to support distribution upgrades.

  Role will set up repositories for Debian Backports for current release,
  previous release and next release, with corresponding symlinks. When a new
  release comes around, this should let existing repositories easily migrate
  from "stable" to "oldstable" and create new "stable" repository for new
  release. [drybjed]

- By default, Debian Backport repositories will support ARM architectures in
  addition to AMD64 and i386. [drybjed]

- ``reprepro_uploaders_local`` variable has been renamed to
  ``reprepro_uploaders_default_rules`` to allow split between "local"
  repositories and repositories for distribution backports. [drybjed]

- Export repositories when configuration of distributions managed on the server
  changes. [drybjed]

- Change the location of gnupg snapshots stored in the DebOps ``secret/``
  directory on Ansible Controller to not create clashes between different hosts
  using the same domain name. [drybjed]

- Add new mirror configuration for Debian GNU/Linux 8 (Jessie). [drybjed]

- Switch Debian mirror servers to new HTTP redirector address. [drybjed]

- Redesign "local" repositories to support distribution upgrades.

  Repository naming scheme has been changed, new naming scheme::

      <release>-<origin>         (production, direct upload denied)
      <release>-<origin>-staging (testing, direct upload allowed)

  Previous, current and next Debian Stable releases are configured when
  repository is enabled on Debian-based hosts. On Ubuntu hosts, only
  repositories for current Ubuntu LTS release are configured at the moment.
