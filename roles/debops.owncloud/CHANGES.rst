Changelog
=========

v0.3.0

*Unreleased*

- Remove most of the Ansible role dependencies.
  Note that ``owncloud_autosetup`` requires that a webserver is installed to
  initialize the ownCloud database.
  Further configuration will not be possible when the database has not been
  initialized.

  Please run the DebOps playbook to make sure that webserver and database are
  ready. [ypid]

- Wrote initial documentation. [ypid]

- Remove the ``owncloud-server`` package from list of installed packages, it
  has been dropped as of ownCloud 9.0. [drybjed]

- Use ``debops.mariadb`` to allow to use MariaDB or MySQL on a remote server. [ypid]
