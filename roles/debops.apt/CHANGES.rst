Changelog
=========

v0.2.0
------

*Unreleased*

- Remove support for ``apt-cacher-ng``. The new role ``debops.apt_cacher_ng``
  handles this now. The overloaded ``apt`` variable as been split into
  ``apt__enabled`` and ``apt__proxy``. [ypid]

- Added ``apt__proxy_bypass_for_bugs_debian_org`` which you can enable if you
  hit a problem with a proxy server not allowing access to
  https://bugs.debian.org. [ypid]

- Removed ``debops.apt_preferences`` as role hard dependency and added
  ``apt__apt_preferences__dependent_list`` which you can feed to
  ``debops.apt_preferences`` in your playbook. [ypid]

- Updated/Reworked documentation. [ypid]

- Changed namespace from ``apt_`` to ``apt__``.
  ``apt_[^_]`` variables are hereby deprecated and you might need to
  update your inventory. This oneliner might come in handy to do this.

v0.1.0
------

*Unreleased*

- Add Changelog. [drybjed]

- Support "stacked inventory variables" for APT sources, repositories, keys and
  lists of mirrors. [drybjed]

- Switch the default Debian mirror to new official redirector at
  http://httpredir.debian.org/. [drybjed]

- Added ``apt__remove_default_configuration`` option which defaults to true.
  This ensures that ``/etc/apt/apt.conf`` is absent. [ypid]

- Use backported apt-cacher-ng on Debian Jessie. [ypid]

- Allow to modify APT sections without defining ``apt__default_sources`` by
  using the added ``apt__sources_sections`` variable. [ypid]

- Remove support for ``unattended-upgrades``. The new role
  ``debops.unattended_upgrades`` handles this now. The ``debops.apt`` role will
  have a task for some time which removes old configuration files related to
  ``unattended-upgrades`` to clean up the old systems. [drybjed]

- Fix deprecation warnings in Ansible 2.1.0. [drybjed]
